# SJ-DECEN 
CYBERBULLYING DETECTION USING A CUSTOM DECEN-INSPIRED DEEP LEARNING APPROACH
==============================================================================

This repository presents a deep learning pipeline for cyberbullying detection,
inspired by the DECEN framework that was originally used for depression detection. The model is trained on the Wikipedia Talk 
Labels: Toxicity Dataset, which contains a highly imbalanced class distribution.

Class Distribution:
- Malicious (1): 10%
- Non-Malicious (0): 90%

DATA PREPARATION STEPS
-----------------------
1. Load and Merge:
   - Loaded train.csv, test.csv, and test_labels.csv.
   - Merged test and test_labels to isolate labeled/unlabeled samples.

2. Text Cleaning:
   - Lowercasing
   - Expanding contractions
   - Removing stopwords and special characters
   - Optionally preserving sentence punctuation

3. Noise Reduction:
   - Removed URLs
   - Replaced repeated characters (e.g., "soooo" -> "so")

4. Export:
   - Saved cleaned datasets for training and evaluation.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
---------------------------
This project is motivated by prior research in two complementary areas:
1. Antisocial Behavior Detection Using Deep Learning:
The study by Zinovyeva et al. (2020) demonstrated how deep learning architectures like CNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs could be used to detect antisocial behavior in online discussions. Their methodology was replicated to establish a performance benchmark for cyberbullying detection.

2. Emotion-Aware Deep Learning for Depression Detection:
The proposed model, SJ-DECEN, is based on the DECEN architecture introduced by Yan et al. (2025) for detecting depression from social media content. DECEN integrates token-level emotion recognition with contextual representations to improve classification accuracy. This approach was adapted to the cyberbullying domain by automating emotion labeling through the NRC Emotion Lexicon and exploring fusion strategies that better capture emotional context.

Yan, Z., Peng, F., & Zhang, D. (2025). DECEN: A deep learning model enhanced by depressive emotions for depression detection from social media content. Decision Support Systems, 114421. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2025.114421

Our contribution lies in the implementation of the DECEN based framework for cyberbullying detection, rather than modifying or extending the baseline models.

CUSTOM MODEL (DECEN-INSPIRED ARCHITECTURE)
------------------------------------------
Built on the DECEN structure with 3 major modules:

1. DER MODULE (Detection-Emotion Recognition)
   - BiLSTM-CRF for token-level emotion labeling
   - Tasks: NER, POS tagging, Chunking

2. ECR MODULE (Emotion-Context Representation)
   - Inputs: 
     * Emotion label embeddings (from DER)
     * Post embeddings (BERT)
   - Fusion Strategies:
     * Concatenation
     * Standardization of emotion vectors (Improvement 1)
     * Residual Dot Product Fusion (Improvement 2)

3. DETECTION MODULE
   - Initial: BiLSTM-FFNN
   - Final: Hybrid CNN + BiLSTM (Single timestep classification)
